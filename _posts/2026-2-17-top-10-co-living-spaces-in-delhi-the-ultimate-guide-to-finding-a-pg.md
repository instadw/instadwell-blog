##  The Delhi Rent Map: What Does it Actually Cost?

Newcomers often have unrealistic expectations. Let’s set the benchmark. Here is what a Standard Single Room (or premium twin sharing) actually costs in 2026.

| Zone            | Key Areas                            | Starting Rent      | Vibe                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| North Delhi     | GTB Nagar, Mukherjee Nagar           | ₹10,000 – ₹13,000  | Student heavy, academic, walkable.        |
| South Delhi     | Saket, Satya Niketan, Katwaria Sarai | ₹12,000 – ₹15,000+ | Posh, cafes, green, expensive.            |
| East Delhi      | Laxmi Nagar, Mayur Vihar             | ₹6,000 – ₹10,000   | Crowded, affordable, CA/UPSC hub.         |
| West Delhi      | Patel Nagar, Rajouri Garden          | ₹8,000 – ₹12,000   | Residential, family-oriented, great food. |
| Affordable Hubs | Uttam Nagar, Johri Farm              | ₹5,000 – ₹8,000    | Cheapest, but often congested/unsafe.     |



Reality Check: If a broker offers you a "Fully Furnished AC PG" in South Delhi for ₹6,000, run. It is a scam.

##  The Metro Spine: Why You Need a "PG Near Metro Station"

In Delhi, traffic is brutal. Living in a PG near a Metro station isn't a luxury; it's a survival requirement.

### 1. The Yellow Line (The Main Artery)

-   Connects:  PG near DU North Campus (Vishwavidyalaya) $\leftrightarrow$ CP $\leftrightarrow$ South Delhi (Saket) $\leftrightarrow$ Gurgaon.
    
-   Who lives here: Everyone. It is the most valuable line for both DU students and Cyber City professionals.
    

### 2. The Pink Line (South Campus Loop)

-   Connects:  PG near DU South Campus (Durgabai Deshmukh) $\leftrightarrow$ Lajpat Nagar $\leftrightarrow$ Mayur Vihar.
    
-   Who lives here: South Campus students (Venky/Motilal) and shoppers who love Sarojini/Lajpat markets.
    

### 3. The Magenta Line (The "Comfort" Line)

-   Connects: Janakpuri $\leftrightarrow$ Hauz Khas $\leftrightarrow$ PG near Noida Border (Botanical Garden).
    
-   Why it wins: It connects West Delhi to South Delhi in minutes and is the cleanest line.
    

### 4. The Blue Line (The Hustler)

-   Connects:  PG near Dwarka $\leftrightarrow$ PG near Karol Bagh $\leftrightarrow$ Noida.
    
-   Reality: High frequency, but insanely crowded. It is the lifeline for UPSC students in Karol Bagh and professionals in Noida.

## Choosing Your Room Type: Boys, Girls, or Co-living?

Finding the right format is just as important as the location.

-   Boys PG in Delhi: usually easier to find with flexible curfews. Look in areas like Vijay Nagar or Laxmi Nagar for budget options.
    
-   Girls PG in Delhi: Safety is the priority. We recommend North Campus (Hudson Lane) or South Delhi (Satya Niketan) where managed buildings offer biometric security and 24/7 guards.
    
-   PG for Working Professionals: If you work in Gurgaon or Noida, look for AC PGs in Saket or Mayur Vihar. These often come with "No Curfew" policies suited for office shifts.
