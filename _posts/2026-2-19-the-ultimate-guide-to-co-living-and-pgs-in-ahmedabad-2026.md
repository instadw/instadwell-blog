### The 2026 Commute: Metro is the New MVP

Finding a paying guest in Ahmedabad now requires a "Metro-first" strategy. As of January 2026, Phase 2 of the Ahmedabad Metro is fully operational, connecting the city center directly to GIFT City and [Gandhinagar](https://instadwell.com/search?lat=23.2156354&lng=72.63694149999999&location=Gandhinagar,%20Gujarat,%20India&city=Gandhinagar&country=India).

-   GIFT City Workers: With over 100,000 jobs projected by 2030, areas like Chandkheda and Gandhinagar are the big winners. The new Purple Line (GIFT City Branch) allows commuters to reach the IFSC in under 15 minutes from GNLU station.
    
-   Students: If you are looking for a PG near Ahmedabad University or PG near IIM Ahmedabad, focus on the Blue Line (East-West Corridor). Stations like Commerce Six Road and Gujarat University have made Navrangpura the most accessible student hub in history.

### Non-Veg and the "Vegetarian Hub" Reality

Ahmedabad remains a conservative food culture. According to local data, over 80% of individual landlords in Navrangpura and Gota prohibit non-veg food (including eggs) inside premises.

-   The Restriction: Local PG hostel in Ahmedabad operators often "monitor" food deliveries.
    
-   The Solution: Managed co-living spaces like Stanza Living or [HelloWorld](https://instadwell.com/properties/3178-helloworld-infinity) are more objective. While kitchens may remain veg, they generally do not intrude on your private food choices or outside deliveries.

### The Math: PG Food vs. Eating Out

-   Managed PG (Food Included): Total monthly cost: ₹12,000 – ₹18,000. Best for affordable PGs in Ahmedabad where budgeting is key.
    
-   Room Only + Eating Out: Room rent: ₹5,000 – ₹10,000 + Daily food (₹300 avg) = ₹14,000 – ₹23,500. Best for foodies who want to explore the night markets of Law Garden.

### The Ultimate PG Decision Checklist

Before you sign for any [PG accommodation](https://instadwell.com/blog/top-10-co-living-spaces-in-pune-and-affordable-student-accommodation-guide-2026) in Ahmedabad, run through this checklist:

-   AC Billing: Expect to pay ₹10-15 per unit. Avoid flat fees!
    
-   Lock-in Period: Aim for a 3-month lock-in to judge quality first.
    
-   Zero Brokerage: Scams are rising; students report losing ₹16k–₹50k to fake brokers. Use [InstaDwell](https://instadwell.com/) to book directly and save a full month’s rent.
    
-   Power Backup: Ensure there is a dedicated generator if you are a professional working from home.
