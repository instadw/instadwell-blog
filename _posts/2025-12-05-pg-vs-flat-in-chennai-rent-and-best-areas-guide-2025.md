##  Why PGs Make More Sense in Chennai

One of the biggest shocks for newcomers is the flat rental deposit rule, many landlords ask for **6 to 10 months of rent upfront**.

* **Flat Example:** ₹20,000 rent → ₹2,00,000 deposit
* **PG Example:** Most verified PG operators ask for just **1–2 months’ deposit**

For most newcomers, PGs are simply **more affordable to move into.**

* Mosquito mesh

 Electricity may be billed separately.
AC usage can add **₹1,500–₹3,000/month.**
