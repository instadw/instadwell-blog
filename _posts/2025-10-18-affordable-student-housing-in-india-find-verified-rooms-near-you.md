##  **The Rising Demand for Student Housing in India**

India is home to over **40 million students** pursuing higher education, with thousands more joining every year.
Cities like **Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Pune, and Delhi** have become education hubs, attracting students from across the country and abroad.

However, this massive demand has created a gap between available accommodations and quality housing options.

* Allow savings for travel or skill-building

In a country as diverse as India, **student housing prices** vary drastically between cities. Finding **budget-friendly PGs, co-living spaces, or apartments** can make a huge difference to your overall experience.

##  **Challenges Students Face in Finding Accommodation**

Despite the demand, many students still struggle with housing due to:

*  **Fake online listings** showing misleading images
*  **Unverified landlords** or unsafe environments
*  **Hidden costs** like maintenance and utilities
