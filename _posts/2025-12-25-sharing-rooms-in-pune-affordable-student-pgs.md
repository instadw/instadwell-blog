----------

## Average Cost of Sharing Rooms in Pune for Students

Sharing room rents in Pune depend mainly on locality, number of roommates, and amenities, not luxury.

### Double Sharing PG (Student Areas)

-   ₹7,000 – ₹12,000 per month (per person)
    
-   ₹15,000+ only in premium or corporate areas
    

Usually includes:

-   Basic furniture
    
-   Food (optional in many areas)
    
-   Wi-Fi & housekeeping (varies)
    

Common student complaints:

-   Food quality may be average
    
-   AC electricity often billed separately
    
-   Higher rent does not always mean better comfort
    

----------

### Triple / Multi-Sharing PG

| Sharing Type | Monthly Rent     | Suitable For             |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| 2-Sharing    | ₹7,000 – ₹12,000 | Students wanting balance |
| 3-Sharing    | ₹5,000 – ₹9,000  | Budget-focused students  |
| 4-Sharing    | ₹4,500 – ₹7,000  | Lowest-cost option       |

Always check room size, ventilation, storage, and bathrooms, not just rent.

----------

## Single Room / 1RK / 1BHK (Student Budget)

-   ₹10,000 – ₹20,000 per month
    
-   In areas like Karve Nagar or Dhayari, a decent 1RK/1BHK is available around ₹12,000–₹15,000
    
-   Best for students who want privacy and control over food
    
----------

## Cheapest Areas for Student PG Sharing in Pune

Students looking to reduce rent usually prefer these localities:

### Karve Nagar / Kothrud

-   1RK / Shared PG: ₹6,000 – ₹10,000
    
-   Calm student crowd
    
-   Close to colleges and coaching hubs
    
-   Best for MIT, Cummins, and nearby institutes
    

Note: The new Aqua Line Metro connects Vanaz (Kothrud) to Ramwadi (Viman Nagar) in ~35 minutes, making commuting much easier for students.

----------

### Wadgaon Sheri / Dhayari / Kharadi Outskirts

-   Affordable PGs and shared flats
    
-   Connectivity varies by exact location
    

----------

### Rawet / Marunji / Akurdi

-   Lower rents
    
-   Good food availability
    
-   Popular among students and IT freshers
    
-   Best for Indira Institute & Balaji Institute students
    

----------

### Viman Nagar

-   Slightly higher rents
    
-   Excellent connectivity and student culture
    
-   Best for Symbiosis students
    

Most of these areas work well if you’re okay with a 15–20 minute commute.

----------

## Facilities to Expect in Affordable Student PGs

Most student PGs offer basic amenities—but quality varies.

### Common Amenities

-   Food (1–3 meals/day)
    
-   Laundry
    
-   Wi-Fi
    
-   Housekeeping
    

### What Students Actually Prioritize

-   Clean rooms
    
-   Safe & peaceful locality
    
-   Hygienic food or food alternatives
    
-   Reliable water & electricity
    

Cleanliness and safety matter far more than luxury features.

----------

## Is Food Included in Most Student PGs in Pune?

Yes but food quality is the #1 complaint among students.

### Student Reality

-   Meals may be repetitive or oily
    
-   Timings can be strict
    

### Pro Tip (Real Student Hack)

In areas like Karve Nagar, Kothrud, and FC Road, many PGs allow you to opt out of food.

Students often save money by:

-   Joining a local Mess / Poli / Bhakri Kendra
    
-   Cost: ₹2,500 – ₹3,000 per month
    
-   Better taste + flexibility
    

This is often cheaper and healthier than paying PG food charges.

----------

## Hidden Charges Students Must Watch Out For

Hidden costs are one of the biggest problems students face.

### Common Hidden Charges

-   “Visit” or booking fees
    
-   ID card or registration charges
    
-   Extra electricity charges (especially AC)
    
-   Internet or maintenance fees
    

### Important Rule

If someone asks for money just to visit a PG, it’s likely a scam.

Always ask for:

-   Complete rent breakup
    
-   Written list of inclusions
    
-   Clear deposit refund policy
    

----------

## How to Avoid PG Scams in Pune

Follow these safety rules:

-   Visit the PG in person
    
-   Talk to existing residents
    
-   Never pay before visiting
    
-   Don’t rely only on photos
    
-   Don’t share documents without verification
    

Many scams happen through WhatsApp groups and unverified brokers.
