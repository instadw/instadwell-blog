Every year, thousands of Indian students study abroad without taking a single education loan.

While studying abroad is often framed as a luxury, for many top talents, it is fully funded by the state. This list is based on the Government of India’s official 2026 report titled “Internationalisation of Higher Education in India” published by [NITI Aayog](https://instadwell.com/blog/niti-aayogs-11-lakh-student-goal-the-untold-housing-crisis), making this one of the most authoritative scholarship resources available online.

This guide reflects patterns from thousands of student housing searches on InstaDwell, where we see students pairing these funding options with [affordable](https://instadwell.com/blog/affordable-student-accommodation-in-pune) living solutions daily.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Do these scholarships include accommodation?**

Most "Fully Funded" scholarships (like Commonwealth and MEXT) provide a monthly stipend or allowance intended to cover housing costs. However, you must usually book the accommodation yourself.

**When should I apply?**

Most government scholarship cycles run between September and January for the following academic year.

**Can I apply for multiple scholarships?**

Yes, but you usually cannot accept more than one government-funded scholarship at the same time. Always check the specific terms of the donor agency.

**When should I book student housing?**

We recommend booking accommodation 3-4 months before your course starts, or as soon as your visa is confirmed. Use our Study abroad housing checklist to ensure you don't miss any critical steps.
