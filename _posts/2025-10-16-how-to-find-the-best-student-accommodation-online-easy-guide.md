### **Step 3: Choose the Right Location**

Location is everything!
Look for areas that are:

* Close to your university or campus
* Connected by public transport
* Near essential amenities (supermarkets, clinics, banks, etc.)

Avoid random social media groups or unverified sites.
Use reliable, verified housing platforms like **InstaDwell**, which offer:
