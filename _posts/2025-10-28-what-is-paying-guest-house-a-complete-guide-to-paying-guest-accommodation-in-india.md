## What Is a PG (Paying Guest)?

A **Paying Guest (PG)** accommodation is a living arrangement where people stay in someone else’s property and pay rent that typically covers not just the room, but also essential services such as **electricity, water, WiFi, meals, housekeeping, and laundry**.

Unlike renting an entire flat, PGs offer furnished single or shared rooms, so residents don’t need to worry about household chores or utility bills.

PGs are often located near **colleges, universities, and business hubs**, making them a perfect fit for students and working professionals who prioritize convenience, affordability, and comfort.
