## About Coliving in India

Coliving in India is a modern, community-driven form of shared living. Residents enjoy private personal spaces alongside shared common areas, amenities, meals, housekeeping, and social experiences. It is especially popular among students, young professionals, and urban migrants who seek affordable, hassle-free, and flexible living without sacrificing comfort or community engagement. Operators typically provide tech-enabled booking, flexible contracts, and vibrant community events to enhance urban living experiences.

Today, many brands are recognized as the offering global-standard community living experiences.

## The Start of Coliving in India

The concept of coliving in India began around 2015–2016, driven by the need to provide hassle-free, fully-furnished accommodation for students and young professionals moving to tier-1 and tier-2 cities.

Some of the first companies to enter the market included:

* **Zostel (2013–2014)** – Initially focused on backpacker hostels, laying the groundwork for community-driven accommodations.
* **Stanza Living (2017)** – Targeted student housing with fully-furnished, serviced residences in major urban centers.
* **Zolo (2015–2016)** – Focused on tech-enabled coliving and flexible stays for young professionals.

These early operators offered essential amenities, meals, and shared spaces, gradually introducing technology-driven booking, app-based management, flexible contracts, and community events. Their innovations helped reduce the typical hassles of urban renting and fostered a strong sense of community, setting the stage for the rapid growth of India’s coliving market.

## The Current Landscape

India’s coliving market has grown rapidly, with operators offering budget hostels, luxury apartments, and tech-enabled homes. Top operators differentiate themselves through pricing, flexibility, amenities, and community engagement. Students, professionals, and digital nomads increasingly prefer coliving over traditional PGs or hostels for the convenience and enriched living experience.
