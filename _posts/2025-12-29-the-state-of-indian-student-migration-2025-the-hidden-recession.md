If you have read the headlines this month, you have likely seen a staggering figure: 1.8 million Indian students are currently studying abroad. This represents a reported 40% jump from the previous year.

But if you are a university stakeholder, a student housing provider, or an investor, you might be wondering: “If numbers are up 40%, why are university applications to the UK and Canada flatlining?”

At InstaDwell, we combined official Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) data with our own "Social Sentiment Analysis" of recent discussions on Reddit communities like r/Indians_StudyAbroad and r/UniUK.

The reality? The "boom" is a statistical illusion. The "University Recession" is real.

----------

## 1. The "Hidden Decline" in Higher Education

The massive growth in the headline number comes from a change in government reporting. For the first time, the 2025 MEA data includes Indian students in K-12 schools abroad.

When we strip out the school data and compare "apples to apples" (University students only), the trend reverses entirely.
