### **1. Introduction**

Finding *[Best PGs & Co-Living in Berlin](https://instadwell.com/search?country=germany&lat=52.52&lng=13.405&location=berlin) * has become one of the biggest challenges international students face today. Over the last decade, both countries have grown into top global destinations for higher education. World-class universities, high living standards, multicultural environments, and career opportunities attract thousands of students every year.

However, the huge increase in international student inflow has created a severe housing shortage, especially in major cities like [Berlin](https://instadwell.com/search?lat=52.52000659999999&lng=13.404954&location=Berlin,%20Germany&city=Berlin&country=Germany), [Munich](https://instadwell.com/search?lat=48.1351253&lng=11.5819806&location=Munich,%20Germany&city=Munich&country=Germany), [Amsterdam](https://instadwell.com/search?lat=52.3675734&lng=4.9041389&location=Amsterdam,%20Netherlands&city=Amsterdam&country=Netherlands), Utrecht, and Rotterdam. Many students begin their semester without confirmed accommodation, pushing them to choose expensive or temporary alternatives.

### **2. Why Student Housing Is a Challenge in Germany & Netherlands**

Both Germany and the Netherlands face similar housing issues, although for different reasons. Understanding them helps students plan better and avoid last-minute panic.

###  Reasons in Germany

* High international student growth: Over 450,000 international students as of 2024.
* Limited on-campus housing; most universities do not offer hostel-style accommodation.
* Rising demand in major cities ([Best PGs & Co-Living in Berlin](https://instadwell.com/search?country=germany&lat=52.52&lng=13.405&location=berlin), [Munich](https://instadwell.com/search?lat=48.1351253&lng=11.5819806&location=Munich,%20Germany&city=Munich&country=Germany), Frankfurt, [Hamburg](https://instadwell.com/search?lat=53.5488282&lng=9.987170299999999&location=Hamburg,%20Germany&city=Hamburg&country=Germany)).
* Slow construction of new student dormitories due to strict urban regulations.
* Increased preference from students for private WGs instead of dorms.

### Reasons in Netherlands

* Severe housing shortage affecting both students and local residents.
* [Amsterdam](https://instadwell.com/search?lat=52.3675734&lng=4.9041389&location=Amsterdam,%20Netherlands&city=Amsterdam&country=Netherlands), Utrecht, Eindhoven, and Groningen are heavily overcrowded.
* Private rental market is expensive and competitive.
* Many landlords prefer Dutch-speaking tenants.
* Universities cannot guarantee housing for international students.

Because of these challenges, students must begin searching several months before arrival and be flexible about location and housing type.
